The camera captures the image of the workspace
Detect the corners of the workspace using openCV

05/14/2024
Record the coordinates of the corners of the workspace. This is the global coordinate system
Convert the global coordinate system into natural coordinate system using isoparamteric mapping

Finally, the isoparamterized coordinates can used to communicate with the robot
